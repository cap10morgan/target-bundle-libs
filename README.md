# target-bundle-libs

A helper to generate `src/deps.cljs` files from `package.json` files. Allows
simple, consistent ClojureScript library development with `:target :bundle`.

The core problem it was created to solve is that out of the box, you can't depend
on foreign JS / NPM libraries in CLJS libraries with `:target :bundle`. Everything
will appear to work until you try to consume the CLJS library in an application.
It won't be able to find the transitive JS libraries. This solves that.

**Note:** You probably want to set the following compiler options in all apps that consume
libraries using this tool:

```clojure
{:install-deps true
 :npm-deps {}} ; :npm-deps set to empty map is only needed if you don't already have it set
```

Unfortunately the compiler (as of 1.10.773) crashes if `:install-deps` is true
but `:npm-deps` isn't set. Hopefully that will be fixed in the future.

If you don't set `:install-deps true` then you'll have to use some other method
to discover install your transitive NPM JS deps. The CLJS compiler can do it
for you, so I recommend just setting it for now.

## Usage

Create a `:js-deps` alias in your `deps.edn`:

```clojure
{:aliases
 {:js-deps
  {:extra-deps {com.timetraveltoaster/target-bundle-libs {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
   :main-opts ["-m" "target-bundle-libs.core"]}}}
```

Then, wherever your build & package pipeline is defined (e.g. a `Makefile`), add this:

`clojure -A:js-deps`

...before the step that packages your JAR file. This will generate a `src/deps.cljs`
file from your `package.json` (it intentionally does not read `package-lock.json` nor
`yarn.lock` because libraries should be compatible with every dependency version they
specify in their `package.json`'s semver ranges).

You should commit your `src/deps.cljs` file to your source repo (e.g. git) and keep it
up-to-date as it changes in there. This is so that you and other developers can depend
on git SHA's and/or local checkouts of your CLJS library and still take advantage of the
transitive JS dep discovering and installation features it provides.

When applications consume your library now (assuming you added the `:install-deps true`
and `:npm-deps {}` entries to your compiler options), the CLJS compiler will see the
`deps.cljs` and install and use your transitive JS deps.

## Background

For a more in-depth discussion of why this is helpful, see my [blog post about
ClojureScript libraries with target-bundle](https://timetraveltoaster.com/clojurescript-libraries-in-2020/).

And the follow-up post introducing this tool here: [https://timetraveltoaster.com/clojurescript-libraries-introducing-target-bundle-libs/](https://timetraveltoaster.com/clojurescript-libraries-introducing-target-bundle-libs/)

## Development

Run the project's tests:

    $ clojure -A:test:runner

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -A:uberjar

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target-bundle-libs.jar

### Bugs

1. Currently this likely assumes too much that should be more flexible / configurable (e.g. file paths).
